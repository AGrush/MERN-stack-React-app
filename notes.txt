//-D means its a dev dependancy, wont get updated to production
npm i -D nodemon

Build server endpoints

2./////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//create client folder
cd client

//install create-react-app globally if you havent already
npm i -g create-react-app

//create it an generate it in the CURRENT client folder
create-react-app .

//add proxy value in frontend package.json so you dont have to do: axios.get('http://localhost:5000/api/items')

//now we configure running the server and front end at the same time with npm install concurrently if we haven't done that already with npm i concurrently on the server folder

//to the scripts in package.json, we add:
"client": "npm start --prefix client" OR "cd client && npm start" 
//to have an ability to just run the react without the server, and then create 
"dev": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\""
//to run them both with one command
// also we create a command for installing the client modules:
"client-install": "npm install --prefix client",


//clean up inside the client src folder remove excess

cd client

//bootstrap allows us to use the bootstrap css, reactstrap allows us to use components out of bootstrap, uuid generates random ids for build testing only, react-transition-group is pretty transitions yay

npm i bootstrap reactstrap uuid react-transition-group
